# IU Class Scheduler

Solo project for an Android development class.

Uses alamkanak's Android-Week-View, Google Maps API.

Android application that provides an easier and more intuitive way to choose classes and create a
semester schedule. The landing page is where the user can search for and add or remove courses. The
second page lets the user pick specific classes in each course. The third page shows a full week of
the created schedule and lets the user switch between first and second eight weeks. The last page uses
Google Maps to show where the users classes are located on campus.

Created using Android Studio.
